AI Based Aatish detection System

# Abstract

Today, electronics have greatly advanced. But in case of electricity and electronic devices, this
reasoning has seen fire accidents due to carelessness of people. Old Detection technology such as
smoke and heat detector fails in vast or complicated spaces They struggle with many issues
ranging from providing on-site inaccuracies and false alarms to delayed responses. Nevertheless,
the practical implementation of these findings has not really been embraced among fire safety
engineering practitioners, who continue to clamour for improved guidance to assist their
decision-making in complicated buildings. Hence, it is not at all surprising that one of the most
amazing areas in research has been an image-based fire detection system. Because now people
totally disarm false alarms and are also confronted with other drawbacks like large architectural
differences among many international building types it promises advantages such as early
detection and the major concern is fire safety in today's larger, more complicated buildings. This
can be a big issue. Traditional fire detection methods sometimes miss (imitate it still was the bad
old days) or give false alarms. In this study, we investigate an advanced method for camera-
based fire detection that makes use of deep learning algorithms more precisely, the
YOLOv8n model. The process involves training the deep learning model to recognize patterns and characteristics of fires in images. Unlike older methods, this approach doesn't rely on manually chosen features, making it more adaptable to different situations.
The system, powered by YOLOv8n, uses cameras as its "eyes" to constantly scan for potential
fires. Once the system spots something that looks like a fire, it can quickly raise an alarm or notify people about the location as we used CCTV camera in our system, any camera that connected to the server or control room, when it finds any potential fire it gives alert, thatâ€™s why it is called as a real time Fire detection system.
Our project focuses on using advanced deep learning, particularly the YOLOv8n model, to
enhance fire detection through cameras. This approach aims to improve accuracy and
responsiveness, providing a cutting-edge solution for fire safety in various settings, we use
Kalman filter for accuracy and tracking and use MPI for multi-core processing and for multi
cameras means our system works on multi cameras at same time and whenever find any
emergency it generates alarm through a buzzer and also send email to the control room.  To put it
simply, this fire monitoring system is a useful addition to the current CCTV cameras for fire
detection.
